                works or sound recordings embodied in such audiovisual work,

                Specific Rules for Musical Works. If you are a composer or
                author of a musical work and have affiliated with a PRO, then
                you must notify your PRO of the royalty free license granted by
                you to PVE NETWORK through these Terms. Each PRO has different
                rules with respect to providing notification for a direct
                license. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance
                with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have
                assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain
                the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty free
                license set forth in these Terms or have such music publisher
                enter into these Terms with PVE NETWORK. Just because you

                  PVE NETWORK AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES,

                  THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE

                  ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE
                  TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. Arbitration is more informal
                  than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
                  instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery
                  than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
                  courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that
                  a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more
                  information about arbitration.
